# Digimon World Re:Digitize Decode Randomizer

This software allows randomizing several aspects of the 2013 released 3DS game "Digimon World Re:Digitize Decode".

# Usage

## Prerequisites 
Before using this software make sure you

* have Java 11 or higher installed
  * you can download it from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
* have a dumped ROM of the game in .CCI/.3DS format (.CIA not yet supported)
  * the ROM can have the English translation patch applied
  * other modifications can generally be compatible as well, but success may vary
* have enough empty disk space for all files created during the randomization
  * 5-10 GiB on the drive you installed the randomizer on should suffice

## Setup

Download the appropriate version for your OS from the [releases tab](https://github.com/SydMontague/DecodeRandomizer/releases) and unpack the downloaded .zip archive in the location you want to install the randomizer at.

Run the `Decode-Randomizer.jar`, press the "Select Base ROM" button and navigate to ROM you want to use as base for the randomizer.
After the ROM has been successfully unpacked you'll be presented with the randomization options.
